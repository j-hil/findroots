Recreating the optional, introductory, non-examinable CATAM project I did in Year 1 of Uni, but in Python.

## Usage

Unknown

## Motivation

Good way to practice using python to manipulate and present numerical data. Plus I just missed doing maths.

Original project material (including MATLAB code) can be found in [old](old/)

## Rough

New things this project has allowed me to experiment with:
* numpy and matplotlib usage
* numerical methods (obvs)
* notebooks
* using mypy with stubs
